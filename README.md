- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jonboy900
- 👀 I have an interest in coding (C,C++,Python) and have produced some comercial software along the way. I was trained as a systems analyst and then move away from programming so:  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python just to refresh some stuff while studying Cyber Security 
- 💞️ I also have a background in Film and Computer Games both industries I have worked in over the years
- 📫 How to reach me ...
